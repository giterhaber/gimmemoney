        <p>I just want to ask if this. is your steam account or not cause I got a problem.</p>

        <p>Supposedly, I was going to report a dude that was buying the items I listed on the market because I didn't get anything from him/her on the steam market and I thought it was you since you have the same profile, I think that crooked dude is impersonating you</p>

        <p>the dude impersonate you and that's why I accidentally reported you for doing illegal purchasing instead of someone else, I messaged the Steam admin and they said that your account will be suspended</p>

        <p>did steam give you a notification about the scam report on your account?</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>I'm really sorry, I tried to tell them that the steam profile was mistakenly reported and that I did not intend to report you but they won't listen to me</p>

        <p>I'm extremely nervous and anxious right now. Please help me to fix this issue before its too late or our accounts might be suspended or we could have a corresponding ban</p>

        <p>I've saved the profile of the respondent. They want you to add their discord for you to explain this issue here: </p>

        <p>help me explain to him that the report i made is just an accident and you're innocent
        </p>

        <p>add him now and explain to him I accidentally reported you for doing illegal purchases instead of someone else.</p>

        <p>just he can notice you right away thats why i messaged you immediately so you can help me to sort this out</p>
