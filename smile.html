        <p>/quote Greetings! Thanks for reaching out! How may I help you?
        </p>
        <p>/quote I am really sorry to hear that. Could you please give me the full details about this accident, provide a screenshot or text conversation between that user? 
        </p>
        <p>/quote To make a screenshot, press the PrtSc key and go to this chat and press Ctrl-v.
        </p>
        <p>/quote I understand the problem and will be happy to help you. Give me a moment while I'm reviewing the report filed on your steam account.
        </p>
        <p>/quote Thank you for waiting. I have the details of your steam account status. You have a pending ban, multiple scam reports and accused of owning duplicated illegal game purchases. If not proven false, it will lead to "Account Deletion." To prove the details are false, I advise you to make an appeal to clear these reports. So would you like to make an appeal?
            </p>
        <p>/quote Let me review your transaction history. Please go to https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/ and make a full screenshot of your purchase history page and send it here.
        </p>
        <p>/quote I'm sorry but it is critical to Include the name at the top page, so we can make sure too that the history came from the same person thanks!
        </p>
        <p>/quote Well done! So now, can you to tell the truth if you are doing fraudulent activity over steam?
        </p>
        <p>/quote Alright, let's see it then. Could I ask if you have discord because I may need to connect your account on our database. Community service#9524
        </p>
        <p>/quote It seems you are not able to cooperate. This tells us that you accept the deletion of the account, admitting the accusations that makes you guilty of doing illegal activities, identity fraud and credit card theft.
