<p>Sorry to disturb you. Can we discuss this for just a minute because it is very important please? I just made a huge terrible mistake and I hope you won't get mad please cause I accidentally reported you for doing illegal purchases instead of someone else, the support said that your account will be suspended. I'm really sorry I tried to tell him that it was a mistake profile id but he wont listen to me I'm not joking on steam he said if you will not help to explain to him your account will be permanently suspended on steam that's why I contacted you I'm really sorry I didn't mean to report you bro can you please help me on explaining to him? I told the support that you are innocent but he is not listening to me. The problem is he needs to add him to clarify the issue or else you will take the ban. https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199470541326</p>
